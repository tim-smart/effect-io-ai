when both succeeds finishes with a tuple of both channel's done value.

import * as Channel from '@effect/stream/Channel'

// Can be accessed like this
Channel.zipPar
```

**Signature**

```ts
export declare const zipPar: {
  <Env1, InErr1, InElem1, InDone1, OutErr1, OutElem1, OutDone1>(
    that: Channel<Env1, InErr1, InElem1, InDone1, OutErr1, OutElem1, OutDone1>
  ): <Env, InErr, InElem, InDone, OutErr, OutElem, OutDone>(
    self: Channel<Env, InErr, InElem, InDone, OutErr, OutElem, OutDone>
  ) => Channel<
    Env1 | Env,
    InErr & InErr1,
    InElem & InElem1,
    InDone & InDone1,
    OutErr1 | OutErr,
    OutElem1 | OutElem,
    readonly [OutDone, OutDone1]
  >
  <Env, InErr, InElem, InDone, OutErr, OutElem, OutDone, Env1, InErr1, InElem1, InDone1, OutErr1, OutElem1, OutDone1>(
    self: Channel<Env, InErr, InElem, InDone, OutErr, OutElem, OutDone>,
    that: Channel<Env1, InErr1, InElem1, InDone1, OutErr1, OutElem1, OutDone1>
  ): Channel<
    Env | Env1,
    InErr & InErr1,
    InElem & InElem1,
    InDone & InDone1,
    OutErr | OutErr1,
    OutElem | OutElem1,

# repeatN

Returns a new effect that repeats this effect the specified number of times
or until the first failure. Repeats are in addition to the first execution,
so that `io.repeatN(1)` yields an effect that executes `io`, and then if
that succeeds, executes `io` an additional time.

Part of the `Effect` module from the `@effect/io` package. Also known as `Effect.repeatN`.

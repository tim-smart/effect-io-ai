# unnested

Returns a new config provider that will automatically un-nest all
configuration under the specified property name. This can be utilized to
de-aggregate separate configuration sources that are all required to load a
single configuration value.

Part of the `Config/Provider` module from the `@effect/io` package. Also known as `Config/Provider.unnested`.

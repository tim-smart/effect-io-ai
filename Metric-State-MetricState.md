# MetricState

A `MetricState` describes the state of a metric. The type parameter of a
metric state corresponds to the type of the metric key (`MetricStateType`).
This phantom type parameter is used to tie keys to their expected states.

Part of the `Metric/State` module from the `@effect/io` package. Also known as `Metric/State.MetricState`.

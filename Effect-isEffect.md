# isEffect

This function returns `true` if the specified value is an `Effect` value,
`false` otherwise.

This function can be useful for checking the type of a value before
attempting to operate on it as an `Effect` value. For example, you could
use `isEffect` to check the type of a value before using it as an
argument to a function that expects an `Effect` value.

Part of the `Effect` module from the `@effect/io` package. Also known as `Effect.isEffect`.

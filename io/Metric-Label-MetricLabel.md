# MetricLabel

A `MetricLabel` represents a key value pair that allows analyzing metrics at
an additional level of granularity.

For example if a metric tracks the response time of a service labels could
be used to create separate versions that track response times for different
clients.

Part of the `Label` module, imported from `@effect/io/Metric/Label`.

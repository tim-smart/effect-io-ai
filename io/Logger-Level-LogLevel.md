# LogLevel

A `LogLevel` represents the log level associated with an individual logging
operation. Log levels are used both to describe the granularity (or
importance) of individual log statements, as well as to enable tuning
verbosity of log output.

Part of the `Level` module, imported from `@effect/io/Logger/Level`.

# Annotated

The `Annotated` cause represents a `Cause` which is annotated with some
arbitrary metadata.

For example, we can annotate a `Cause` with a trace to assist in debugging.

To import and use `Annotated` from the "Cause" module:

```ts
import * as Cause from '@effect/io/Cause'

// Can be accessed like this
Cause.Annotated
```

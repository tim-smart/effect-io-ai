# acquireRelease

This function constructs a scoped resource from an `acquire` and `release`
`Effect` value.

If the `acquire` `Effect` value successfully completes execution, then the
`release` `Effect` value will be added to the finalizers associated with the
scope of this `Effect` value, and it is guaranteed to be run when the scope
is closed.

The `acquire` and `release` `Effect` values will be run uninterruptibly.
Additionally, the `release` `Effect` value may depend on the `Exit` value
specified when the scope is closed.

Part of the `Effect` module from the `@effect/io` package. Also known as `Effect.acquireRelease`.

# dayOfMonth

Cron-like schedule that recurs every specified `day` of month. Won't recur
on months containing less days than specified in `day` param.

It triggers at zero hour of the day. Producing a count of repeats: 0, 1, 2.

NOTE: `day` parameter is validated lazily. Must be in range 1...31.

Part of the `Schedule` module from the `@effect/io` package. Also known as `Schedule.dayOfMonth`.

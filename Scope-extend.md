# extend

Extends the scope of an `Effect` workflow that needs a scope into this
scope by providing it to the workflow but not closing the scope when the
workflow completes execution. This allows extending a scoped value into a
larger scope.

Part of the `Scope` module from the `@effect/io` package. Also known as `Scope.extend`.

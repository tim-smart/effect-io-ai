# either

Returns an effect whose failure and success have been lifted into an
`Either`. The resulting effect cannot fail, because the failure case has
been exposed as part of the `Either` success case.

This method is useful for recovering from effects that may fail.

The error parameter of the returned `Effect` is `never`, since it is
guaranteed the effect does not model failure.

Part of the `Effect` module from the `@effect/io` package. Also known as `Effect.either`.

# mergeAllPar

Merges an `Iterable<Effect<R, E, A>>` to a single effect, working in
parallel.

Due to the parallel nature of this combinator, `f` must be both:

- commutative: `f(a, b) == f(b, a)`
- associative: `f(a, f(b, c)) == f(f(a, b), c)`

It's unsafe to execute side effects inside `f`, as `f` may be executed
more than once for some of `in` elements during effect execution.

Part of the `Effect` module from the `@effect/io` package. Also known as `Effect.mergeAllPar`.

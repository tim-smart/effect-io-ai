# MetricLabel

A `MetricLabel` represents a key value pair that allows analyzing metrics at
an additional level of granularity.

For example if a metric tracks the response time of a service labels could
be used to create separate versions that track response times for different
clients.

Part of the `Metric/Label` module from the `@effect/io` package. Also known as `Metric/Label.MetricLabel`.

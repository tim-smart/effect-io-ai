# timeoutTo

Returns an effect that will timeout this effect, returning either the
default value if the timeout elapses before the effect has produced a
value or returning the result of applying the function `f` to the
success value of the effect.

If the timeout elapses without producing a value, the running effect will
be safely interrupted.

Part of the `Effect` module from the `@effect/io` package. Also known as `Effect.timeoutTo`.

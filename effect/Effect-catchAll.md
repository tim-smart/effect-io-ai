# catchAll

Recovers from all recoverable errors.

**Note**: that `Effect.catchAll` will not recover from unrecoverable defects. To
recover from both recoverable and unrecoverable errors use
`Effect.catchAllCause`.

To import and use `catchAll` from the "Effect" module:

```ts
import * as Effect from "effect/Effect"
// Can be accessed like this
Effect.catchAll
```

**Signature**

```ts
export declare const catchAll: {
  <E, A2, E2, R2>(f: (e: E) => Effect<A2, E2, R2>): <A, R>(self: Effect<A, E, R>) => Effect<A2 | A, E2, R2 | R>
  <A, E, R, A2, E2, R2>(self: Effect<A, E, R>, f: (e: E) => Effect<A2, E2, R2>): Effect<A | A2, E2, R | R2>
}
```

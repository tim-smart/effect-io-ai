# zipLatest

Zips the two streams so that when a value is emitted by either of the two
streams, it is combined with the latest value from the other stream to
produce a result.

Note: tracking the latest value is done on a per-chunk basis. That means
that emitted elements that are not the last value in chunks will never be
used for zipping.

To import and use `zipLatest` from the "Stream" module:

```ts
import * as Stream from "effect/Stream"
// Can be accessed like this
Stream.zipLatest
```

**Signature**

```ts
export declare const zipLatest: {
  <A2, E2, R2>(that: Stream<A2, E2, R2>): <A, E, R>(self: Stream<A, E, R>) => Stream<[A, A2], E2 | E, R2 | R>
  <A, E, R, A2, E2, R2>(self: Stream<A, E, R>, that: Stream<A2, E2, R2>): Stream<[A, A2], E | E2, R | R2>
}
```

# Effect

The `Effect` interface defines a value that describes a workflow or job,
which can succeed or fail.

**Details**

The `Effect` interface represents a computation that can model a workflow
involving various types of operations, such as synchronous, asynchronous,
concurrent, and parallel interactions. It operates within a context of type
`R`, and the result can either be a success with a value of type `A` or a
failure with an error of type `E`. The `Effect` is designed to handle complex
interactions with external resources, offering advanced features such as
fiber-based concurrency, scheduling, interruption handling, and scalability.
This makes it suitable for tasks that require fine-grained control over
concurrency and error management.

To execute an `Effect` value, you need a `Runtime`, which provides the
environment necessary to run and manage the computation.

To import and use `Effect` from the "Effect" module:

```ts
import * as Effect from "effect/Effect"
// Can be accessed like this
Effect.Effect
```

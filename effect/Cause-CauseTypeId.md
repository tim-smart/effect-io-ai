# CauseTypeId

A unique symbol identifying the `Cause` type.

**Details**

This provides a symbol that helps identify instances of the `Cause` data
type. This can be used for advanced operations such as refining types or
building internal utilities that check whether an unknown value is a `Cause`.

To import and use `CauseTypeId` from the "Cause" module:

```ts
import * as Cause from "effect/Cause"
// Can be accessed like this
Cause.CauseTypeId
```

**Signature**

```ts
export declare const CauseTypeId: typeof CauseTypeId
```

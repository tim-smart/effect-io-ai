# OpenAPISpec

This model describes the OpenAPI specification (version 3.1.0) returned by
{@link fromApi}. It is not intended to describe the entire OpenAPI
specification, only the output of `fromApi`.

To import and use `OpenAPISpec` from the "OpenApi" module:

```ts
import * as OpenApi from "@effect/platform/OpenApi"
// Can be accessed like this
OpenApi.OpenAPISpec
```

## as

Transforms a schedule to always produce a constant output.

**Details**

This function modifies a given schedule so that instead of returning its
computed outputs, it always returns a constant value.

This is useful when you need a schedule for timing but donâ€™t care about its
actual output, or when you want to standardize results across different
scheduling strategies.

**Signature**

```ts
declare const as: { <Out2>(out: Out2): <Out, In, R>(self: Schedule<Out, In, R>) => Schedule<Out2, In, R>; <Out, In, R, Out2>(self: Schedule<Out, In, R>, out: Out2): Schedule<Out2, In, R>; }
```

# DurationFromMillis

A schema that transforms a (possibly Infinite) non negative number into a
`Duration`. Treats the value as the number of milliseconds.

To import and use `DurationFromMillis` from the "Schema" module:

```ts
import * as Schema from "effect/Schema"
// Can be accessed like this
Schema.DurationFromMillis
```

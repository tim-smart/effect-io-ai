# HttpApiGroup

An `HttpApiGroup` is a collection of `HttpApiEndpoint`s. You can use an `HttpApiGroup` to
represent a portion of your domain.

The endpoints can be implemented later using the `HttpApiBuilder.group` api.

To import and use `HttpApiGroup` from the "HttpApiGroup" module:

ts
import \* as HttpApiGroup from "@effect/platform/HttpApiGroup"
// Can be accessed like this
HttpApiGroup.HttpApiGroup
undefined

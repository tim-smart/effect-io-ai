Once a Message is sent to an entity to be processed,
the state of that message over that entity is either Acknoledged (not yet processed) or Processed.

To import and use `MessageState` from the "MessageState" module:

ts
import \* as MessageState from "@effect/cluster/MessageState"
// Can be accessed like this
MessageState.MessageState
undefined

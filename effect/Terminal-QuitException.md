# QuitException

A `QuitException` represents an exception that occurs when a user attempts to
quit out of a `Terminal` prompt for input (usually by entering `ctrl`+`c`).

To import and use `QuitException` from the "Terminal" module:

```ts
import * as Terminal from "@effect/platform/Terminal"
// Can be accessed like this
Terminal.QuitException
```

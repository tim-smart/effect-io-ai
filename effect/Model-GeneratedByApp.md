# GeneratedByApp

A field that represents a column that is generated by the application.

It is required by the database, but not by the JSON variants.

To import and use `GeneratedByApp` from the "Model" module:

```ts
import * as Model from "@effect/sql/Model"
// Can be accessed like this
Model.GeneratedByApp
```

**Signature**

```ts
export declare const GeneratedByApp: <S extends Schema.Schema.All | Schema.PropertySignature.All>(
  schema: S
) => GeneratedByApp<S>
```

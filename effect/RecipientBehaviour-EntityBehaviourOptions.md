# EntityBehaviourOptions

This are the options for an EntityBehaviour. This controls the entityMaxIdleTime,
check out more on that over the ShardingConfig.
This allows to override the setting for a specific entity.

To import and use `EntityBehaviourOptions` from the "RecipientBehaviour" module:

ts
import \* as RecipientBehaviour from "@effect/cluster/RecipientBehaviour"
// Can be accessed like this
RecipientBehaviour.EntityBehaviourOptions
undefined

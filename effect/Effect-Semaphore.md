# Semaphore

A semaphore is a synchronization mechanism used to manage access to a shared
resource. In Effect, semaphores help control resource access or coordinate
tasks within asynchronous, concurrent operations.

A semaphore acts as a generalized mutex, allowing a set number of permits to
be held and released concurrently. Permits act like tickets, giving tasks or
fibers controlled access to a shared resource. When no permits are available,
tasks trying to acquire one will wait until a permit is released.

To import and use `Semaphore` from the "Effect" module:

```ts
import * as Effect from "effect/Effect"
// Can be accessed like this
Effect.Semaphore
```

# RuntimeException

An error representing a runtime error.

**Details**

This interface is used for errors that occur at runtime but are still
considered recoverable or typed.

To import and use `RuntimeException` from the "Cause" module:

```ts
import * as Cause from "effect/Cause"
// Can be accessed like this
Cause.RuntimeException
```

# PCGRandom

PCG is a family of simple fast space-efficient statistically good algorithms
for random number generation. Unlike many general-purpose RNGs, they are also
hard to predict.

To import and use `PCGRandom` from the "Utils" module:

ts
import \* as Utils from "effect/Utils"
// Can be accessed like this
Utils.PCGRandom
undefined

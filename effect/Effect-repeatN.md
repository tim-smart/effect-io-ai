# repeatN

Returns a new effect that repeats this effect the specified number of times
or until the first failure. Repeats are in addition to the first execution,
so that `io.repeatN(1)` yields an effect that executes `io`, and then if
that succeeds, executes `io` an additional time.

To import and use `repeatN` from the "Effect" module:

```ts
import * as Effect from "effect/Effect"
// Can be accessed like this
Effect.repeatN
```

**Signature**

```ts
export declare const repeatN: {
  (n: number): <R, E, A>(self: Effect<R, E, A>) => Effect<R, E, A>
  <R, E, A>(self: Effect<R, E, A>, n: number): Effect<R, E, A>
}
```

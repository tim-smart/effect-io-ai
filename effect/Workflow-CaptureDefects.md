## Workflow.CaptureDefects

If you set this annotation to `true` for a workflow, it will capture defects
and include them in the result of the workflow or it's activities.

By default, this is set to `true`, meaning that defects will be captured.

**Signature**

```ts
declare class CaptureDefects
```

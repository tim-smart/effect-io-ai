## Schedule.addDelayEffect

Adds an effectfully computed delay to every interval in a schedule.

**Details**

This function modifies a given schedule by applying an additional delay to
each interval, where the delay is determined by an effectful function. The
function takes the scheduleâ€™s output and returns an effect that produces a
delay duration.

**See**

- `addDelay` If you need to compute the delay using a pure function.

**Signature**

```ts
declare const addDelayEffect: { <Out, R2>(f: (out: Out) => Effect.Effect<Duration.DurationInput, never, R2>): <In, R>(self: Schedule<Out, In, R>) => Schedule<Out, In, R2 | R>; <Out, In, R, R2>(self: Schedule<Out, In, R>, f: (out: Out) => Effect.Effect<Duration.DurationInput, never, R2>): Schedule<Out, In, R | R2>; }
```

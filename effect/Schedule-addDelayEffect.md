# addDelayEffect

Adds an effectfully computed delay to every interval in a schedule.

**Details**

This function modifies a given schedule by applying an additional delay to
each interval, where the delay is determined by an effectful function. The
function takes the scheduleâ€™s output and returns an effect that produces a
delay duration.

To import and use `addDelayEffect` from the "Schedule" module:

```ts
import * as Schedule from "effect/Schedule"
// Can be accessed like this
Schedule.addDelayEffect
```

**Signature**

```ts
export declare const addDelayEffect: {
  <Out, R2>(
    f: (out: Out) => Effect.Effect<Duration.DurationInput, never, R2>
  ): <In, R>(self: Schedule<Out, In, R>) => Schedule<Out, In, R2 | R>
  <Out, In, R, R2>(
    self: Schedule<Out, In, R>,
    f: (out: Out) => Effect.Effect<Duration.DurationInput, never, R2>
  ): Schedule<Out, In, R | R2>
}
```

# Reloadable

A `Reloadable` is an implementation of some service that can be dynamically
reloaded, or swapped out for another implementation on-the-fly.

To import and use `Reloadable` from the "Reloadable" module:

```ts
import * as Reloadable from 'effect/Reloadable'

// Can be accessed like this
Reloadable.Reloadable
```

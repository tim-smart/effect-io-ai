Package: `effect`<br />
Module: `Schedule`<br />

## Schedule.tapInput

Returns a new schedule that runs the given effectful function for each input
before continuing execution.

**Details**

This function allows side effects to be performed on each input processed by
the schedule. It does not modify the scheduleâ€™s behavior but ensures that the
provided function `f` runs before each step.

**Signature**

```ts
declare const tapInput: { <In2, X, R2>(f: (input: In2) => Effect.Effect<X, never, R2>): <Out, In, R>(self: Schedule<Out, In, R>) => Schedule<Out, In & In2, R2 | R>; <Out, In, R, In2, X, R2>(self: Schedule<Out, In, R>, f: (input: In2) => Effect.Effect<X, never, R2>): Schedule<Out, In & In2, R | R2>; }
```

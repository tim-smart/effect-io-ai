# Primitive

A `Primitive` represents the primitive types supported by Effect CLI.

Each primitive type has a way to parse and validate from a string.

To import and use `Primitive` from the "Primitive" module:

```ts
import * as Primitive from "@effect/cli/Primitive"
// Can be accessed like this
Primitive.Primitive
```

# Resource

A `Resource` is a possibly resourceful value that is loaded into memory, and
which can be refreshed either manually or automatically.

To import and use `Resource` from the "Resource" module:

```ts
import * as Resource from 'effect/Resource'

// Can be accessed like this
Resource.Resource
```

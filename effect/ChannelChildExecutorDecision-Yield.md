# Yield

Pass execution to the next substream. This either pulls a new element
from upstream, or yields to an already created active substream.

To import and use `Yield` from the "ChannelChildExecutorDecision" module:

```ts
import * as ChannelChildExecutorDecision from 'effect/ChannelChildExecutorDecision'

// Can be accessed like this
ChannelChildExecutorDecision.Yield
```

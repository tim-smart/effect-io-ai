# Schedule

A `Schedule<Env, In, Out>` defines a recurring schedule, which consumes
values of type `In`, and which returns values of type `Out`.

Schedules are defined as a possibly infinite set of intervals spread out over
time. Each interval defines a window in which recurrence is possible.

When schedules are used to repeat or retry effects, the starting boundary of
each interval produced by a schedule is used as the moment when the effect
will be executed again.

Schedules compose in the following primary ways:

- Union: performs the union of the intervals of two schedules
- Intersection: performs the intersection of the intervals of two schedules
- Sequence: concatenates the intervals of one schedule onto another

In addition, schedule inputs and outputs can be transformed, filtered (to
terminate a schedule early in response to some input or output), and so
forth.

A variety of other operators exist for transforming and combining schedules,
and the companion object for `Schedule` contains all common types of
schedules, both for performing retrying, as well as performing repetition.

To import and use `Schedule` from the "Schedule" module:

```ts
import * as Schedule from 'effect/Schedule'

// Can be accessed like this
Schedule.Schedule
```

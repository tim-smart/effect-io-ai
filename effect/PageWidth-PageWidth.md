# PageWidth

Represents the maximum number of characters that fit onto a single line in a
document. The layout algorithms will try to avoid exceeding the set character
limit by inserting line breaks where appropriate (e.g., via `softLine`).

To import and use `PageWidth` from the "PageWidth" module:

```ts
import * as PageWidth from "@effect/printer/PageWidth"
// Can be accessed like this
PageWidth.PageWidth
```

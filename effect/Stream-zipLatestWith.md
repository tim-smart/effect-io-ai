# zipLatestWith

Zips the two streams so that when a value is emitted by either of the two
streams, it is combined with the latest value from the other stream to
produce a result.

Note: tracking the latest value is done on a per-chunk basis. That means
that emitted elements that are not the last value in chunks will never be
used for zipping.

To import and use `zipLatestWith` from the "Stream" module:

ts
import \* as Stream from "effect/Stream"
// Can be accessed like this
Stream.zipLatestWith
undefined

**Signature**

```ts
export declare const zipLatestWith: {
  <AR, ER, RR, AL, A>(
    right: Stream<AR, ER, RR>,
    f: (left: AL, right: AR) => A
  ): <EL, RL>(left: Stream<AL, EL, RL>) => Stream<A, EL | ER, RL | RR>
  <AL, EL, RL, AR, ER, RR, A>(
    left: Stream<AL, EL, RL>,
    right: Stream<AR, ER, RR>,
    f: (left: AL, right: AR) => A
  ): Stream<A, EL | ER, RL | RR>
}
```

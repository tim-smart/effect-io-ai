# Result

The Micro Result type is a data type that represents the result of a Micro
computation.

It uses the `Either` data type to represent the success and failure cases.

To import and use `Result` from the "Micro" module:

```ts
import * as Micro from "effect/Micro"
// Can be accessed like this
Micro.Result
```

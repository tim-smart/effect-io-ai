# let

The "do simulation" in Effect allows you to write code in a more declarative style, similar to the "do notation" in other programming languages. It provides a way to define variables and perform operations on them using functions like `bind` and `let`.

Here's how the do simulation works:

1. Start the do simulation using the `Do` value
2. Within the do simulation scope, you can use the `bind` function to define variables and bind them to `Either` values
3. You can accumulate multiple `bind` statements to define multiple variables within the scope
4. Inside the do simulation scope, you can also use the `let` function to define variables and bind them to simple values

To import and use `let` from the "Either" module:

```ts
import * as Either from "effect/Either"
// Can be accessed like this
Either.let
```

**Example**

```ts
import { Either, pipe } from "effect"

const result = pipe(
  Either.Do,
  Either.bind("x", () => Either.right(2)),
  Either.bind("y", () => Either.right(3)),
  Either.let("sum", ({ x, y }) => x + y)
)
assert.deepStrictEqual(result, Either.right({ x: 2, y: 3, sum: 5 }))
```

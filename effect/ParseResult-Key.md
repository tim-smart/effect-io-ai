# Key

The `Key` variant of the `ParseIssue` type represents an error that occurs when a key in a type literal or record is invalid.

To import and use `Key` from the "ParseResult" module:

```ts
import * as ParseResult from "@effect/schema/ParseResult"
// Can be accessed like this
ParseResult.Key
```

# DateTimeUtc

Defines a schema that attempts to convert a `string` to a `DateTime.Utc` instance using the `DateTime.unsafeMake` constructor.

To import and use `DateTimeUtc` from the "Schema" module:

```ts
import * as Schema from "@effect/schema/Schema"
// Can be accessed like this
Schema.DateTimeUtc
```

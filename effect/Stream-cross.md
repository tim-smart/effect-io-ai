# cross

Composes this stream with the specified stream to create a cartesian
product of elements. The `that` stream would be run multiple times, for
every element in the `this` stream.

See also `Stream.zip` for the more common point-wise variant.

To import and use `cross` from the "Stream" module:

```ts
import * as Stream from "effect/Stream"
// Can be accessed like this
Stream.cross
```

**Signature**

```ts
export declare const cross: {
  <R2, E2, A2>(that: Stream<R2, E2, A2>): <R, E, A>(self: Stream<R, E, A>) => Stream<R2 | R, E2 | E, [A, A2]>
  <R, E, A, R2, E2, A2>(self: Stream<R, E, A>, that: Stream<R2, E2, A2>): Stream<R | R2, E | E2, [A, A2]>
}
```

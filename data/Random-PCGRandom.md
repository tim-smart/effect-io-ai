# PCGRandom

PCG is a family of simple fast space-efficient statistically good algorithms
for random number generation. Unlike many general-purpose RNGs, they are also
hard to predict.

To import and use `PCGRandom` from the "Random" module:

```ts
import * as Random from '@effect/data/Random'

// Can be accessed like this
Random.PCGRandom
```

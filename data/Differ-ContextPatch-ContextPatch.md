# ContextPatch

A `Patch<Input, Output>` describes an update that transforms a `Env<Input>`
to a `Env<Output>` as a data structure. This allows combining updates to
different services in the environment in a compositional way.

Part of the `ContextPatch` module, imported from `@effect/data/Differ/ContextPatch`.

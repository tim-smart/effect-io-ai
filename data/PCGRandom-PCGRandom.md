# PCGRandom

PCG is a family of simple fast space-efficient statistically good algorithms
for random number generation. Unlike many general-purpose RNGs, they are also
hard to predict.

To import and use `PCGRandom` from the "PCGRandom" module:

```ts
import * as PCGRandom from '@effect/data/PCGRandom'

// Can be accessed like this
PCGRandom.PCGRandom
```

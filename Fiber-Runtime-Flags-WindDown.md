# WindDown

The wind down flag determines whether the Effect runtime system will execute
effects in wind-down mode. In wind-down mode, even if interruption is
enabled and a fiber has been interrupted, the fiber will continue its
execution uninterrupted.

Part of the `Fiber/Runtime/Flags` module from the `@effect/io` package. Also known as `Fiber/Runtime/Flags.WindDown`.

# hourOfDay

Cron-like schedule that recurs every specified `hour` of each day. It
triggers at zero minute of the hour. Producing a count of repeats: 0, 1, 2.

NOTE: `hour` parameter is validated lazily. Must be in range 0...23.

Part of the `Schedule` module from the `@effect/io` package. Also known as `Schedule.hourOfDay`.

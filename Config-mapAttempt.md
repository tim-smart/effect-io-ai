# mapAttempt

Returns a config whose structure is the same as this one, but which may
produce a different value, constructed using the specified function, which
may throw exceptions that will be translated into validation errors.

Part of the `Config` module from the `@effect/io` package. Also known as `Config.mapAttempt`.

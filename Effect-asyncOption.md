# asyncOption

Imports an asynchronous effect into a pure `Effect` value, possibly returning
the value synchronously.

If the register function returns a value synchronously, then the callback
function `Effect<R, E, A> => void` must not be called. Otherwise the callback
function must be called at most once.

The `FiberId` of the fiber that may complete the async callback may be
provided to allow for better diagnostics.

Part of the `Effect` module from the `@effect/io` package. Also known as `Effect.asyncOption`.

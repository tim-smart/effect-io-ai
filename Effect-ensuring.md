# ensuring

Returns an effect that, if this effect _starts_ execution, then the
specified `finalizer` is guaranteed to be executed, whether this effect
succeeds, fails, or is interrupted.

For use cases that need access to the effect's result, see `onExit`.

Finalizers offer very powerful guarantees, but they are low-level, and
should generally not be used for releasing resources. For higher-level
logic built on `ensuring`, see the `acquireRelease` family of methods.

Part of the `Effect` module from the `@effect/io` package. Also known as `Effect.ensuring`.

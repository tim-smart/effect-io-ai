# retry

Retries with the specified retry policy. Retries are done following the
failure of the original `io` (up to a fixed maximum with `once` or `recurs`
for example), so that that `io.retry(Schedule.once)` means "execute `io`
and in case of failure, try again once".

Part of the `Effect` module from the `@effect/io` package. Also known as `Effect.retry`.
